In contrast to subdomain takeover, [**Domain Takeover**](https://redhuntlabs.com/blog/5-ways-to-exploit-a-domain-takeover-vulnerability/) occurs when the organization did not renew its domain but still use it in their code and infrastructure. When the attacker registers the abandoned domain, they own the domain, including its subdomains and other types of DNS records.

**Don’t get confused between domain takeover and subdomain takeover. They are two separate vulnerabilities.**
